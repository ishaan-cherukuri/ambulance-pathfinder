# Ambulance-Pathfinder
An app for ambulance personnel to effectively find a route to the areas in need. 

According to the National Institutes of Health, 700 people died due to poor ambulance response time in rural areas, just in Ireland. If sites like this can even save one person, it's worth it.

# Installation

```bash
conda install -f environment.yml
```
